    description: "I have had the pleasure of engaging MELmed Electrical to ramp down and deinstall several MRI systems I have had come out of Australia.  The project management team pays attention to the details, tracks the project timelines, MELmed knows and works with all the key players, OEMâ€™s, Riggers, Logistics, which creates a seamless transition.  David and his team are very knowledgeable in multiple diagnostic imaging modalities.  David is a true professional that oversees a job from system inspection to completion of the deinstallation.  I look forward to working with MELmed on all future projects.",
